# Data-Analysis-Students-Performance

Project for the Masters' degree course «Programming Tools and Technologies for Data Science» (2023).

This project investigates the impact of various factors on student performance in Mathematics, Reading, and Science using data from the "Program for International Student Assessment" (PISA) 2015. The dataset contains information on 15-year-old students from different countries. 

According to the requirements of the assignment, a report was compiled with the discovered insights (see Report-Students-Performace).

In this project, all data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps were conducted using the R programming language (libraries: data.table, ggplot2) and the report was made using LaTeX.
